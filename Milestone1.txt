Milestone 1 — Project Setup & Core Infrastructure

Goal: Establish the basic LibGDX project, core screens, and essential architecture.

Sub-Milestone 1.1 — Project Initialization

 Configure Gradle dependencies for LibGDX, and asset loading.

 Set up project directory structure as per GDD:

 Constants/
 Screens/
 ECS/
 Game/
 UI/


 Sub-Milestone 1.2 — Constants & Asset Manager

 Create Constants.java for major constants (screen size, player speed, fire rate).

 Create AssetManager singleton class to load textures, sounds, and music.

 Define asset paths for sprites, audio, and UI elements.


 Sub-Milestone 1.3 — Base Game Class & Starter Screen

 Implement GameMain.java as entry point (extends Game).

 Implement StarterGameScreen with:

Title

Play & Exit buttons

Basic background animation

 Ensure screen transition from StarterGameScreen → GameScreen.

Deliverable: Blank LibGDX project running with starter screen and working asset loader.
